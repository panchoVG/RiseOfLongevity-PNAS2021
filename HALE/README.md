This folder contains the following files:

1) HALEvsLE.R: This file can be executed to upload data and reproduce the figure and table from the published article. Any reader should be able to run the code in R or RStudio, with no need to manipulate the file. The file also contains the function to carry out the Monte Carlo simulation that estimates the uncertainty intervals of the sex-specific slopes of the best-practice linear trends in healthy life expectancy (HALE) and life expectancy.

2) IHME-GBD_2019_DATA-HALE.csv: This file contains sex-specific healthy life expectancy estimates from 1990 to 2019 for Japan and Singapore. Data are borrowed from the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) 2019 Study (http://ghdx.healthdata.org/gbd-results-tool, downloaded on August 27, 2021).

3) IHME_GBD_2019_LIFE_TABLES_LE.csv: This file contains sex-specific life expectancy estimates from 1990 to 2019 for Iceland, Japan, Singapore, and Switzerland. Data are borrowed from the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) 2019 Study (http://ghdx.healthdata.org/gbd-results-tool, downloaded on August 27, 2021).
